-- CSE 180 Winter 2022 Lab2 create.sql which you're asked to modify

-- Note that Vehicles has an attribute, OwnerID that didn't appear in Lab1.
-- Also there's a Foreign Key constraint on OwnerID, requiring that every OwnerID 
--       be a custom in Customers.

-- Following two lines are not needed in your solution.
DROP SCHEMA Lab2 CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA Lab2;
SET SEARCH_PATH TO Lab2;

-- The comments that appear below are not needed in your solution.

-- INT is equivalent to INTEGER.
-- DECIMAL is equivalent to NUMERIC.
-- CHAR is equivalent to CHARACTER.
-- Specific spacing doesn't matter.
